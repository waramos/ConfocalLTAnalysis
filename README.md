# ConfocalLTAnalysis
This project aims to expedite the analysis of line traces extracted from confocal images. Its primary application will be on identifying puncta along neural processes and the overlap between fluorescent channels's puncta. This automated colocalization analysis will hopefully allow us to determine whether the data suggest that there are separate compartments, budding of some sort, or if the tagged proteins are within the same compartment. Furthermore, future elaborations on this project will apply the same algorithms to confocal image stacks as well as produce novel volumetric analysis and visualization(s) to further determine compartmentalization and overlap.
